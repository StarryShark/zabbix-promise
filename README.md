# Zabbix API Client

Zabbix is an open source monitoring software that can monitor pretty much everything like networks, servers, applications, etc. You may learn more about Zabbix at [www.zabbix.com](https://www.zabbix.com/).

**Zabbix-promise** is a JavaScript package for Node.js runtime environment to interact with Zabbix APIs. The package is written to support JavaScript Promise and Async/await interfaces. Zabbix-promise implements Zabbix sender protocol in pure JavaScript code, and there are no other package dependencies, just the Node.js runtime.
